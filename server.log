Starting Schwab API Server (No Credentials Mode)
==================================================
Server will run on localhost:3457

The server will start without credentials.
You can initialize credentials later using one of these methods:

1. Using the client:
   client.initialize_credentials(app_key, app_secret)

2. Using JSON string:
   client.send_request('{"action": "initialize_credentials", "app_key": "...", "app_secret": "..."}')

3. Using file + JSON:
   client.send_request("base_credentials.json", '{"app_key": "...", "app_secret": "..."}')
